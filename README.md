# foget

A simple program to remind one about other programs. Could also be used as a quick terminal note taking app.
Also, written in Rust so it's blazing fast ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸš€

## Building

Just simply build with Cargo. Just Like `cargo build --release`.

## Contributing

I am open for any feature or pull requests. I only ask to use the default rust format provided by the rust-analyzer and to please be patient with me.

## License

The project uses an MIT license because I can't be bothered to deal with more complicated ones or to think about it for long.
